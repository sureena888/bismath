## Examples

# Hello World Function

    equals(string "Hello", string "World")

# Variable Assignment

    integer someNumber = 10
    float anotherNumber = -7.145
    string someString = "Welcome to Bismath!"

# Basic Algebra functions

    integer a = 2 + 4
    integer b = 5 + (7 - 9) * (4 + 1)
    integer c = 2 ** 5

    float d = 3.32 + 9.14 * 4
    float e = 3 ** -3

# Calculate the area of a circle given a radius

    integer someArea = Circle.area(integer 34)

# Fibonnaci

# Hello World Function {

# equals("Hello, World)

}

# Fibonnaci

# function integer fibonnaci(integer num){{

    does num == 0?
        make 0
    or does num == 1 or does num ==2?
        make 1
    make fibonnaci(integer (num subtract 2)) add fibonnaci(integer (num subtract 1))

}}
function integer fibonnaci(integer num){{
        does num == 0?
            make 0
        or does num == 1 or does num == 2?
            make 1
        make fibonnaci(integer (num - 2)) add fibonnaci(integer (num - 1))
    }}
