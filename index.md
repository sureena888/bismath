# Welcome to Bismath

Welcome to the compiler for Bismath! With a goal of making math a lot easier for programmers, Bismath aims to provide its users with a variety of functions to make everything from simple math to more difficult topics such as calculus and linear algebra easier! We are hoping to create a user friendly and fun way for users to experience and understand math, through exciting ways of engagement and the connection between math and crystals.

## About Bismath

Bismath is a mathematical statically typed programming language that is the intersectiomn of math and crystal, hetre to help mathemeticians make lenar algebra easier!

## Our Story

When thinking of the possible new programming languages, we struggled to find one that mixed our interest and goal of the language. We wanted a language that would be different, fun to use, something new. Eventually we stumbled upon the idea of integrating crystals with out interest of math. Coming up with a name was hard since we had so many options yet none of them stuck. As we continued to think we stumbled upon the crystal form of bismuth. 
	From there on, we knew exactly what we wanted to call our language BISMATH. We had finally found our name and next was to create our language. As we started our early stages of development, we started by just integrating basic math functions into our language. However, we slowly began to evolve into our final product. Since our language is the intersection of math and crystals, we decided to make the functions we use all be named after crystals. Each crystal providing a different function and taking in an array, list, or even matrix. 
	We wanted our language to be for anyone who wants to use it but geared our target audience at mathemeticians. We didn’t want our language to only cover basic math so we decided to focus mainly on linear algebra and how our program can help people with it. Though we might have not known where we’d end up, we finally were able to come up with a language that makes us proud. 

### Examples

A basic "isEven" function that takes in a vector and asses if it's even
```
function isEven(vector) {
    for num in vector {
        (num % 2 != 0) -> {
            output false;
        } otherwise {
            put "So far, so good!";
        }
    }
    output true;
}

example = <2,4,6,7,8>;

```
